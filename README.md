# Assignment Description

Time to put it all together! Use everything we’ve covered so far - SASS, Vue, AJAX, databases and Fetch to create a dynamic one-page app based on our class build. 

Click on one of the Mini models to show more content / data about that model. 

You will be navigating around in your app using Vue lifecycle hooks, components, and AJAX where appropriate.

# Assignment Requirements

Create an AJAX request for the mini data housed in your database using the Fetch API or the XHTTP object. Use that application state to build out your application’s view (the mini app splash/home page).

Your XHTTP / Fetch function should handle the stages of an AJAX request gracefully - give some feedback if the request fails (use separate functions / handlers for each stage of an AJAX request). 

Most importantly, handle failure first - what happens if you can’t connect, if the resource is missing, etc. This is UX / UI - give the user some visual feedback.

If the AJAX request is successful, build out your view - the content of the page - using the
response data (the application state).
